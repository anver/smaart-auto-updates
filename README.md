WordPress Plugin Update Checker
===============================

This plugin offers custom plugins the feature to update like plugins hosted on 
wordpress.org. lugins hosted on wordpress.org doesn't need updation manually 
since WordPress provides automatic updates of all the plugins hosted on 
wordpress.org via the WordPress backend.

To update a plugin installed from the wordpress codex the user has to navigate 
to the plugins admin page and click on the update link to update the plugin to 
it's latest version, that easy it is, but unfortunately there is nothing
out of the box for custom plugin developers to update their plugins 
automatically via the WordPress plugins admin page. This class will solve that 
issue by providing the automatic update feature to update the plugin from the 
plugin authors external servers.
